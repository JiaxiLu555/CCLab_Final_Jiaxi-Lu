   <p class="description">For the reflection on my p5 project, Iâ€™ll focus on my design process and collaboration with my partners. The p5 sketch I created involves an interactive visual experience that explores the concept of evolving visual languages in digital communication. The design process started with brainstorming sketches and background stories shared within the group, focusing on how visual language shapes our online interactions. Based on this collective information, I developed a new character that explores how visual language evolves and influences engagement in modern communication. The final sketch represents a dynamic and abstract interpretation of this idea, offering a playful but reflective experience for the viewer.The background story of the character I developed in my p5.js project is deeply connected to the theme of evolving visual languages in digital communication. The character, a digital being born out of the chaotic and ever-changing landscape of memes, emojis, and GIFs, exists in a world where communication is largely visual and symbolic. They navigate a universe where abstract shapes and colors convey emotions and ideas, constantly adapting and shifting to new trends. This character embodies the fluidity and creativity of online interactions, symbolizing how people connect and interpret meaning in the digital age, often through visuals rather than words.As the world changes and new memes and symbols emerge, the character evolves too, learning new ways to communicate and reflect the culture around them, making them both a part of the digital ecosystem and a reflection of how humans use technology to shape their reality.
