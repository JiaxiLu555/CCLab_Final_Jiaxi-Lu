   <p class="description">I started designing the optical illusion by researching patterns and animations that create visual effects. I explored examples of optical illusions and tutorials in p5.js, focusing on how motion and depth can be perceived. Inspired by circular patterns and alternating colors, I used loops and rotation to create a hypnotic animation. I began with basic sketches and evolved the design to fill the canvas with a grid of patterns. I fine-tuned the illusion by adjusting rotation speed, color, and spacing. The use of loops allowed for repeated elements, while if-else statements added color changes for a dynamic effect. This optical illusion could be used in browser extensions for animated backgrounds, wearable tech like LED clothing, or digital installations in public spaces. Throughout the project, I learned about the details needed to create effective illusions and enjoyed working with p5.js to explore visual effects, which deepened my understanding of how they influence perception.
