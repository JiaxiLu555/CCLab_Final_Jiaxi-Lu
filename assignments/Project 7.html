   <p class="description">For my autobiographical game, I set out to create a simple tile-matching experience that reflects how the repetition of online visual language like memes and emojis shapes our digital environments and emotional landscapes. And due to the randomness at the beginning of the game, there is a possibility that the game cannot be ended and will continue to be played by the player. This random customized experience simulates the impact of online languages, and the randomness also simulates the way people obtain information in their daily lives based on these random or targeted pushes. Randomness and minimal planning make my life full of fun and a certain amount of chaos. Inspired by classic games like Same Game, I aimed to make the mechanics intuitive while using the abstract visual style to represent my personal story and state of mind. The autobiographical aspects are conveyed through the act of clearing away colorful blocks that fill the screen. This represents my attempts to find clarity and space for myself amidst the vibrant but overwhelming flood of information and stimuli in online spaces. With each matched set, a bit more space opens up, paralleling a feeling of relief or lightness.
