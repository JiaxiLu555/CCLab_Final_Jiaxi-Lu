   <p class="description">After reviewing the programming I wrote for my experimental project, I see that the interplay between randomness and structure is key. The code allows for a generative and evolving output, which aligns with my exploration of visual languages in digital spaces. By introducing randomness in movement and form, Iâ€™m reflecting on how users interact with ever-changing online visuals. This project has deepened my understanding of how fluidity in design can mirror the unpredictable nature of online communication and engagement, making the visuals more dynamic and immersive.
