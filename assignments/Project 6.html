   <p class="description">Through the process of simulating social media platforms and visualizing their interactions using bubbles, I discovered how dynamic and unpredictable online spaces can be, reflecting the chaotic nature of digital engagement. Designing the bubbles to move and interact randomly mirrored the experience of scrolling through the internet, where connections between users, ideas, and visuals are fleeting and spontaneous. This assignment deepened my understanding of how visual language plays a role in creating a sense of identity for different platforms, like Twitter’s blue tones or Instagram’s vibrant aesthetics, and how these symbols shape our interactions with them. In self-tracking this project, I realized that my personal engagement with these platforms is similarly fragmented and nonlinear—just like the bubbles, my attention jumps between content without a clear path. This highlighted a personal pattern: I rely heavily on visual cues to navigate online spaces, often engaging more with aesthetically pleasing or familiar elements.
